;;; I'm leaving a naive implementation of Batcher's algorithm here as a

;;; the parallel version, the two inner loops over j and i have been replaced
;;; by one large invocation of LAZY-FUSE, and the longer of the two inner loops
;;; is used to construct shapes of all the upper halves of each pairwise
;;; comparison.
