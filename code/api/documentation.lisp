(document-function range
  "Returns a new, normalized range from the supplied parameters.
This function can be invoked with one, two or three integers.  If it is called
with a single argument, the result is a range starting from zero, with step
size one, up to but excluding the supplied argument.  If the range constructor
is called with two arguments, the result is still a range with a step size
of one, but with the first argument as the inclusive lower bound, and with the
second argument as the exclusive upper bound.  The three argument version
behaves just like the two argument version, except that the additional third
argument denotes the step size.  The sign of the step size gives the direction
of the range: If the sign is positive, then the exclusive upper bound must be
larger than the inclusive lower bound or the resulting range is empty.  If the
sign is negative, the first argument is used as an inclusive upper bound, and
the second argument is used as an exclusive lower bound."

broadcasting of values.

More precisely, the processing maintains a lazy array that is initialized to
the result of applying LAZY-ARRAY constructor to the supplied first argument,
and which is successively updated it with the result of applying one modifier
at a time according to the following rules:

1. If the modifier is an invertible transformation, reorder the elements of
   that array according to that transformation.  If the lazy array has lower
   rank than expected from the transformation, broadcast it first to that rank.
   If the lazy array has higher rank than expected from the transformation,

2. If the modifier is a function, apply it to the shape of the lazy array to
   obtain a number of new modifiers as multiple values.  Process the new
   modifiers as if they were supplied instead of this function modifier.

3. If the modifier is a shape designator then move, broadcast or sample each
   axis of the lazy array to match that shape.  If the lazy array has lower
   rank than the designated shape, first broadcast it to that rank.  If the
   lazy array has higher rank than the designated shape, leave the remaining
   axes as they are and later append them to the shape of the resulting lazy
   array. For each axis, derive the mapping from the range of the lazy array to
   the corresponding range of designated shape according to the following
   rules:

   a) If both the source range and the target range have the same size, move
      the elements of that axis so that they end up on the target range while
      maintaining the original order.

   b) If the source range has a size of one, broadcast it to the target range

(document-function lazy-reduce
  "Returns the lazy arrays that are reduction of the supplied

vector, this function operates as follows:

1. If the vector has zero elements, return the scalar that is the result of
   invoking the supplied function with zero arguments.  This behavior is
   analogous with Common Lisp's REDUCE function and allows graceful handling of
   many built-in functions.

2. If the vector has an even number of elements, split it into two vectors of
   half the size of the original one, where the first vector contains all the
   elements with an even index, and the second vector contains all the elements
   with an odd index.  Map the supplied function, which must accept two
   arguments and return one value, over these two vectors to obtain a single
   vector of results.  Process the resulting vector with step 2 or step 3,
   depending on whether it has an even or an odd number of elements.

3. If the vector has an odd number of elements distinguish three cases:

   a) If there is a leftover element from one of the previous steps, append it
      at the end of the vector.  The resulting vector has an even number of
      elements.  Process it with step 2.

   b) Otherwise, if the vector has exactly one element, this element is the
      result of the reduction.  Return it.

   c) Otherwise, remove the last element of the vector and store it as the
      leftover element for use in step 3a.  Process the remaining elements with
      step 2.

In addition to this simple case of reducing a vector into a scalar, this
function supports three further generalizations:

- If the argument is an array with rank larger than one, the reduction is
  carried out along the first axis only, and all the remaining axes are handled
  by carrying out multiple reductions in parallel.  In that case, the result is
  not a scalar but an array whose rank is one less than before.

- Instead of supplying a function as the first argument, one may also supply a
  list of functions.  In that case, the supplied arrays are first reduced with
  the first of those functions, the results thereof are reduced with the second
  of those functions, and so on.

- Instead of reducing a single array with a function that takes two arguments
  and returns one value, one may also reduce k arrays with a function that
  takes 2k arguments and returns k values.  In that case, all the supplied
  arrays are first broadcast to have the same shape, and these arrays are
  processed exactly like in the case of reducing a single vector except that
  values are selected from all k arrays simultaneously, resulting in 2k
  arguments being passed to the supplied function, and returning k lazy arrays
  as a result.

A final piece of advice: when reducing a vector that is possibly empty, it is
advisable to stack a neutral element at the beginning or the end of that vector
to make it non-empty.

(document-function compute
  "Takes any number of arguments that must be lazy array designators and
returns the same number of possibly specialized regular arrays with the
corresponding computed contents.  Whenever a shape of any of the supplied lazy
arrays has as step size other than one, or an offset other than zero, that
array is deflated before being computed, i.e., each axis is shifted to begin
with zero, and divided by the step size.

As a special case, whenever this function would return an array with rank zero,
it instead returns the sole element of that array.  The reason for this
treatment of scalars is that Petalisp treats every object as an array, whereas
a Common Lisp array of rank zero and the object therein are distinct entities.
Of those two distinct representations, the non-array one is usually more useful
for further processing, so this is the one being returned.

All the heavy lifting in Petalisp happens within this function.  The exact
details of how it operates aren't important for an application programmer, but
it is valuable to understand the rough steps that happen under the hood.  The
individual steps of computing some lazy arrays are as follows:

1. Convert each supplied argument to a lazy array.

2. Reshape each lazy array whose so that it has a step size of one and an
   offset of zero.

3. Determine the dependency graph whose roots are the deflated lazy arrays,
   whose interior nodes are calls to lazy map, lazy reshape, or lazy fuse, and
   whose leaves are wrapped regular arrays or the index components of some
   shape designator.

4. Optimize the dependency graph, discard all unused parts, and plan a schedule
   that is fast and has reasonable memory requirements.

5. Execute the schedule on the available hardware.  Make use of all processing
   units, accelerators, or even distributed systems where possible. Gather the
   results in the form of regular arrays.

6. Change the internal representation of all the originally supplied lazy
   arrays so that future calculations involving them directly use the computed
   results.

7. Return the results as multiple values, while replacing any array with rank
   zero with the single element contained in that array.

This function is the workhorse of Petalisp.  A lot of effort went into making
it not only powerful, but also extremely fast.  The overhead of calling it
instead of invoking an already compiled and optimized program is usually just a
few microseconds, so this may be the only evaluation interface that you ever
need."
