;;; Colors
;;;
;;; Each color is represented as a positive integer.  The color N is the
;;; integer whose binary representation is all zeros except for the Nth
;;; bit.  So first color is #b1, the second color is #b10, and so forth.
;;; This representation has the advantage that operations on sets of colors
;;; can be implemented efficiently as logical operations on integers.
