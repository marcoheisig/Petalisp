;;; Generic Functions

;;; These first three generic functions compute Graphviz attributes for the
;;; entire graph, individual nodes, and individual edges, respectively.
;;; Each method on any of these three generic functions must return a
;;; property list of valid Graphviz attributes.
;;;
;;; The method combination GRAPHVIZ-ATTRIBUTES ensures that if a particular
;;; key appears in the property lists of several applicable methods, only
;;; the corresponding value in the property list of the most specific
;;; applicable method is used.  For example, consider the following
;;; definition of SOME-GRAPH:
;;;
;;; (defclass some-graph (graph) ())
;;;
;;; (defmethod graphviz-node-attributes
;;;     ((graph some-graph) (node t))
;;;   '(:style :filled
;;;     :fillcolor :white
;;;     :shape :box))
;;;
;;; In this setup, the following code defines a subclass of SOME-GRAPH,
;;; where nodes inherit the :STYLE and :SHAPE attribute, but where each
;;; node is colored red:
;;;
;;; (defclass red-graph (some-graph) ())
;;;
;;; (defmethod graphviz-node-attributes
;;;     ((graph red-graph) (node t))
;;;   '(:fillcolor :red))

  (:method-combination graphviz-attributes))

;;; The caption and properties of a node are used to compute its label.
;;; The caption of a node must be a string that is printed prominently in
;;; the first line of the node.  The properties of a node must be an alist,
;;; whose keys and values are strings. Each alist entry is rendered as a
;;; row below the caption.  Using APPEND as the method combination for node
;;; properties allows several applicable methods to contribute to the list
;;; of properties.
;;;
;;; For example, the following code could be used to display hypothetical
;;; person objects as nodes, using their full name as caption and metadata
;;; such as age and weight as rows below the caption:
;;;
;;; (defmethod graphviz-node-caption
;;;     ((graph some-graph) (person person))
;;;   (person-full-name person))
;;;
;;; (defmethod graphviz-node-properties
;;;     ((graph some-graph) (person person))
;;;   `(("age" . ,(princ-to-string (person-age person)))
;;;     ("weight" . ,(princ-to-string (person-weight person)))))
;;;
;;; Assuming a class FEMALE-PERSON that is a subclass of PERSION, we can
;;; register the additional information with the following method:
;;;
;;; (defmethod graphviz-node-properties
;;;     ((graph some-graph) (person female-person))
;;;   `(("gender" . "female")))

;;; The edge drawing protocol is somewhat involved, but for a good reason.
;;; We want to be able to subclass graphs to add or remove edges or to
;;; change the appearance of some edges.  To do so, the protocol works in
;;; three steps.
;;;
;;; 1. The generic function GRAPHVIZ-POTENTIAL-EDGES is used to determine
;;;    the set of edge types that potentially reach a node.
;;;
;;; 2. The generic functions GRAPHVIZ-OUTGOING-EDGE-TARGETS and
;;;    GRAPHVIZ-INCOMING-EDGE-ORIGINS are used to query for incoming and
;;;    outgoing edges of each of the previously determined edge types.
;;;
;;; 3. The current graph type, edge type, start node, target node and the
;;;    position of the edge in the sequence returned from the previous step
;;;    are used to derive the attributes of that edge.

;;; The generic function GRAPHVIZ-KNOWN-NODES is necessary to describe
;;; graphs that are not fully connected.  It returns a list of nodes that
;;; are related to the current node, even though there is no edge that
;;; connects them.

(defgeneric graphviz-known-nodes (graph node)

;;; This generic function decides what kind of graph to use by default for
;;; a given node.
