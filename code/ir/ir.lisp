;;; Reasoning About Memory Locality
;;;
;;; If multiple consecutive loads or stores reference the same memory
;;; location, that memory reference can usually be served from a cache and
;;; is much faster.  Because data is eventually evicted from caches, it
;;; makes sense to rearrange buffers and kernel iteration spaces in such a
;;; way that the innermost loops of each kernel (i.e., the higher axes)
;;; have better data locality.
;;;
;;; The way we optimize for data locality is by introducing a notion of
;;; reuse potential.  Assuming a cache that is large enough to hold all
;;; elements referenced while traversing a particular axis of the iteration
;;; space, all loads with the same permutation and scalings but different
;;; offsets may lead to cache reuse.  We call this maximum number of
;;; attainable cache reuses the reuse potential.
;;;
;;; A reuse potential can be computed both for kernels and for buffers.  In
;;; both cases, we can then optimize the memory locality of the kernel or
;;; buffer by permuting its axes such that those with the hightes reuse
;;; potential appear last.
